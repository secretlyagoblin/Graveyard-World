The party wakes in Last Gift after two months on the road, crossing the vast desert of Oria’s Vigil, delivering forty mules, lead by the caravan master Yorvis Heue, from Terak Tel to a mine far from civilisation.

The party quickly discovers an issue – no local guides will take Yorvis any further east, due to a line of cairns laid across the savanah. The village elder, a gnoll by the name of Rhyser Rotahn, informs the party that her lover and the villages best tracker, Kurk Roteh, has gone missing on the other side of the cairns. As the party will be using Last Gift as their base of operations for the foreseeable future, they agree to track down Kurk as a portion of thier material contribution in exchange for room and board.
 
Travelling east, they find the cairns just as the sun sets. After distrupting one of the cairns, the party observes constructs, smoke-filled suits of armour, both humanoid and bestial, and eventually draw the attention of the intelligence controlling them, a green fire watching from a tower in the distance.
 
The party parleys with the intelligence, and Orgmo agrees to the prisoner transfer with Kurk – “someone must burn the books,” says the fire, though it does not care who. Orgmo is taken, but leaves a trail for his hound to follow, and the party trails them at a distance.
 
Cresting a hill, Orgmo observes he is being taken to an ancient structure carved into the side of a high sandstone cliff. Observing the murals and cross referencing with a local legend, Orgmo realises this is the home of an ifrit, chained into servitude by the old empire and clearly recently reawakened.
 
No-pockets and Ursula follow Orgmo into the ruins, sneaking their way towards a vast library. As Kurk emerges from the depths, Ursula creates a distraction by dislodging a massive rock, giving No-Pockets time to pull Kurk to saftely and Orgmo to escape to the upper levels, where he comes face to face with the ifrit, 10 feet tall and wrapped in billowing green fire.
 
Ursula strikes the demon in the head with an arrow, but the two are both overpowered by the creatues powerful flaming attacks.
 
No-Pockets uses this opportunity to enter the library, clearly warded from the ifrit, (and answering the question of why it needed mortal servants to procure books), which the ifrit has been ritually burning to create new smoke servants. Quickly locating and stealing the most expensive looking tome, locked away in an ornate box, No-Pockets inadvertantly lowers the wards protecting the space.
 
The ifrit, suddenly aware of this, makes its way back to the library, where No-Pockets stabs it in the back with a dagger.
 
Simultaniously, Ursula and Orgmo break through a collapsed doorway into daylight, and move a mirror to flood the library with daylight, apparently banishing the creature in a flash of light, leaving Kurk rescued, the library, and the eastern plains, safe for further exploration.
