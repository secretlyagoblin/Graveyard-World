The party gathers their things and makes their way out of the university proper into Highhaven itself, with the goal of finding Jasper Goodbarrel who would help them on their way to the Crystal Spire.

While the party relaxed, Kharl made his way to the local Church of Tymora party, making their way out of the city after their failed quest to retrieve Bojangles spellbook at the university, and convinced them to stay and protect the citizens in the inevitable battle for Highhaven.

With the melee over, the party stops to nurse their wounds, sheltering in a portable hole pulled from Dakarai’s Cloak of Many Things, in the middle of nowhere, as night approaches…
