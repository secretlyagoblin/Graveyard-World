Varyk, awaking alone on the shore of the Beast Coast, makes his way north and finds the wreck of ‘The Considered Response to Inquiry.’ Noticing it behaving strangely, he is able to commune with it, teleporting himself to an ascended version of the ship on a still seam, covered in dead elves. Realising the ship can be salvaged, he goes out in search of his party. Spying a ruin above that seems to exist in both ascension and the material plane, he finds his way into an ancient cliff-side fortress, half eroded into the sea. Here he finds the corpse of an ancient wizard, and takes his Fly Boots. Meeting up with a party of orcs, he makes his way along the same pilgrimage they had undertaken, catching up with Kharl and Dakarai just as Urllex disappears into Orthac’s Jawbone.

The night before, Dakarai dreams of of Naivara talking with the drow that have been hunting the party. Though they speak in elvish, Dakarai identifies the words ‘Seshelas’ and ‘Gundren.’ Hoping to find Naivara before it is too late, Kharl, Dakarai and Varyk decide to travel light, leaving their allies and pets at Ittur and flying across the estuary to Castien. They are slowed when they realise they have to fly around a flock of feasting harpies, and arrive at the city as night falls. Flying close to the palace walls, they are engaged by a group of Alu-Tel scouts, and escape using sorcery to conjure storms and darkness to mask their retreat.
 
Separated as they arrive in the city, Kharl and Varyk befriend a group of Kenku playing chaospheres on a rooftop. The Kenku seem to have some fleeting relationship with Halia Thornton, as Kharl’s keen ear picks up from their speech. They also inform Kharl that there are ways into the palace through caves beneath the cliffs.
 
Experiencing the effects of the sand-curse, Dakarai finds himself at the Palace of Tears, before finding his way to the port district, narrowly dodging a group of familiar dwarfs near a safely docked ‘Heft and Consideration.’ Dakarai finds his way to a bar, where he befriends a 4-foot tall saurial paladin known as ‘Dragonbait.’ Drinking late into the night, Dragonbait and Dakarai run straight into the dwarfs from before, and go their separate ways as Varyk creates a wall of fire as a distraction. As they settle into an attic hideaway in the manor district, Dakarai dreams, not of the Palace of Tears, but of a dank and ancient crumbling stone building, and is set upon by insects, before waking.
