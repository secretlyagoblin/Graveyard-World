Having completed her task, as promised Arvahnt takes Recrentius to Nink, who tells them that if they want a new  Book of Laws, they will need to travel to the [Library of the God of Bloody Light](/wikis/library-of-the-god-of-bloody-light), where a mighty press exists that will allow the book to be rebound.

The party travels out of Arkenreln and into the wilds, braving bad weather and fierce monsters, eventually making their way into the library, which has been corrupted by a powerful chaos druid, [Azenkazahel](/characters/azenkazahel), who is intent on the Book of Laws never being rebound.
