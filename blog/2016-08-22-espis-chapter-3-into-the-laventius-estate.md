The party returns to Phandalin with their hobgoblin prisoner, and spends the day in training, rest and recuperation. Varyk spends this time on an information gathering expedition, and overhears a few of the Redbrands plotting to silence him that night.

The party sets up an ambush, capturing three of these attackers and killing one. During the fighting, Dakarai, a lost vagabond, warns Urllexin to approaching enemies, and is welcomed into the group. Clues on the bodies of the prisoners lead the party to discover that the mayor was killed at some point earlier in the night.
 
The next morning, interrogation of the prisoners leads the party to discover that the Redbrands are hiding out beneath the Laventius Estate, to which they find two entrances. Qelline Alderleaf and her son being kidnapped raises the stakes, and the party enters the catacombs beneath the estate, fighting their way, room by room into the heart of the Redbrand base of operations (with the help of a few good berries).
 
While there are mostly humans and a few Bugbears camping in the ruins, Varyk does come across a dangerous lurking Nothic, and promises it the staff of the wizard Glasstaff if it leaves the party alone.
 
We left the party interrogating a drunk, just before discerning that the room they are in sits opposite Glasstaffs quarters.
