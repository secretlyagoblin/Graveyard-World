In the weeks after Gundren’s death, the party drifts apart. Varyk, after being briefly detained, flees to the woods, and attempts to learn more about his possession and the amulet that seems to be holding it at bay. Lorna resumes a life of living off the land, dwelling on the outskirts of Phandalin.

Urllex returns with Hudson to New Haven, working with the Crossroad Knights and shipping confiscated White Iron weapons back home to [the Beast Coast](/wikis/the-beast-coast).
 
Kharl, after a brief period of soul searching, spends time with Aust and Aelar, learning the ways of the ‘civilised’ religions. During this time, he gains favour with the church of Tymora.
 
The party is reunited when word spreads that the mysterious monk Dakarai, who has been comatose since the seige of the spellforge, has awoken. Dakarai, after a game of 7-sphere chaosphere chess with Eilyac, the current avatar of Death, has indeed awoken a changed man, and has taken to drinking heavily in The Sleeping Giant.
 
Reunited again, the party travels to [Arborox](/wikis/arborox) to deal with some unfinished business – the young green dragon that has made the town as its nest. The party develops a plan to stab the dragon with an improvised iron stake, and then defeat the creature by heating the metal magically. Sneaking up to the tower, Dakarai accidently wakes the beast prematurely, and has to make a quick escape on his broomstick. The dragon goes to give chase, but is distracted by Kharl, taunting the creature from the middle of the road.
 
The dragon dives for Kharl, and the party uses the opportunity to pile on – the dragons hide is pierced and damage is piled on, while illusions of party members emerging out of the woods confuse it. Very quickly the creature is overpowered and killed.
 
Returning to Phandalin, the party hears news that Hudson is looking to escort Iarno Alberk back to [Highhaven University](/wikis/the-portal-city-of-highhaven) where he is to be tried as a deserter. Seeing this as an opportunity to visit the school and fulfil Gundren’s request to seek out the headmaster, the party sets out for [the Portal City of New Haven](/wikis/the-portal-city-of-new-haven), and after a leisurely few days shopping and drinking,  takes the wizard into their custody.
 
After escorting Iarno through the Lodestone portal into Solitude, the party makes for the university gates. The party is detained by Leto Halfhand, the elven spellsword in charge of defence and security. The party is escorted into the university (their weapons and magical items confiscated), and given visitors robes. Heading up the main path into the campus, Kharl walks straight into an invisible statue of the Wizard Magicami, left there in a last act of defiance before he escaped into Ascension.
