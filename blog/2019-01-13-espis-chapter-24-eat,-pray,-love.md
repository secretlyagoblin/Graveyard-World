Rivaan Kathvishargolin prepares to board the Heft and Consideration as Lorna and Urllex hide themselves to avoid being caught, surmising he is here for the Bracers.

Looking for another canoe, Dakarai starts emptying his robe of items, revealing, among other things, two trained mastiffs that he names “Grog” and “Grog.”
