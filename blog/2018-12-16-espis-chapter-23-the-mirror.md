Moving along the route determined by the scrying ceremony, the party makes it’s way out to sea, and gets to know the crew of the ‘Heft and Consideration.’ After a few days at sea, the party spies a signal flare sent out by a stranded ship. Dakarai approaches the ship, crashed against huge rocks, and sees a dwarf dragged below deck by a dark shape, returning to warn the party. The party is asked by Captain Vondal Ungart to board the vessel and discover what has happened.

Boarding the vessel and descending into the hold of the ship, the party finds the crew slaughtered. In the lowest level of the hold, knee deep in feted water, the party spies a mirror in the distance. They are quickly ambushed by demonic goat creatures that kidnap Varyk and drag him to the surface, with Lorna in pursuit. In the hold, the party engage the demons in combat. Kharl approaches the mirror and is enraptured by it, forced to attack his own party. The same charm falls upon Dakarai, and they engage each other in combat. Urllex kills the final demons with a thunderwave, knocking the mirror into the water and breaking the spell.
 
Meanwhile, Varyk is dragged before a lone tree at the top of the rocks, revealed to be full of worms. Kyuss speaks to Varyk, giving him an offer – Kyuss will call off his demons, if Varyk helps him find the entity that has split Kyuss into two beings, one a mindless vulture, the other an immaculate salesman. Varyk agrees, and Kyuss disappears.
 
Due to Urllex’s thunderwave, the ship turns on its side and begins to sink. The party escapes, but Kharl stays behind to cleanse the ship and recover the captain’s logbook. He sinks with the ship, but casts waterwalk on himself and pulls himself up from the depths.
 
The party returns to the ship and Kharl confronts Captain Vondal, accusing him of cowardice, leaving the crew feeling conflicted about the groups presence. A shaky peace follows for the next few days of travel, when Kharl spots from the back of the ship something he didn’t expect to see – the ‘Eat, Pray, Love,’ appraching at speed, captained by Kharl’s cousin, Rivaan Kathvishargolin…
