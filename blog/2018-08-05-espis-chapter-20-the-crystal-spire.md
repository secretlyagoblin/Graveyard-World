After a cold night sheltered in the snow, the party makes their way towards the Crystal Spire, all the while followed from above by an unknown druid and stalked at a distance by an invisible demon. Progress is slow – the party is not used to arctic conditions and loses time getting turned around. After another night in the snow, the group finds their way to the entry of the Spire, guarded by the bored fox demon [Yrkhetep](/characters/yrkhetep), who, due to a lack of visitors, has turned the entrance to the Spire into a tropical sculpture garden, dedicated to his foxy visage.

Presenting the demon with the three seals of Highhaven, the party is allowed into the main scrying room of the complex. After examining the machinery and praying on it’s use, Dakarai, Varyk and Kharl are able to piece together how to open the portal to Ascension, where they enter into Lillen’s domain, causing the fractal palace to immediately become unstable.
 
Fleeing into the fractal palace, the party finds themselves in a recursive, endless library, filled with more of Lillen’s notes. By piecing these notes together with those Varyk had already collected, they are able to fully decode her notes, revealing a piece of her history that allows them further into the maze. Each layer of the maze seems to be a thousand fractal pathways, linked with Lillen or one of her companions, with the true entrance hidden among hundreds of near copies.
 
Through, the home of Urzoth, aunt of Urllex, followed by the temple of Rhobsarendor for Kharl’s grandfather, and the Gnarl for the druid Kaz, the party sees glimpses of the parties history, a group pulled together by natural forces in opposition to a dark force growing in the Deep.
 
While exploring, the party begins to become aware that they are not alone – thousands of fragments of Naivara can be seen trying endless doors around them, the wizard resorting to brute force to beat the party to their prize.
 
The party then finds themselves deep within Kyuss’ lair, and discover the treasure that the old party sought – seven vials, almost entirely lacking in ornament, each filled with a different liquid. The shade of Gundren asks Lillen why there are seven vials, as they were only sent to retrieve six. Lillen replies to leave the seventh, not even to look at it. The party takes six, leaving the last, pure black, alone in it’s recess.
 
The last vision the party is left with is with Tock, the partys rogue, going his own way, the adventure finished, one of the vials in a circlet around his neck. The vial seems to have given Tock the ability to misty step at will. Lillen cautions him to take his curse seriously, as it will overcome him if he isn’t careful, but Tock remains jovial. The party is able to deduce that from their last encounter with the Drow, where the could now misty step, that Tock has been killed, and his power somehow absorbed by his attackers.
 
With the last layer of the maze completed, the party finds themselves in a final, pyramidal structure, at the center of which is their prize – an empty vial, floating in space, surrounded by a floating orb of sand…
