For a variety of different reasons, and with different goals, a party of adventurers escorts a caravan of supplies to the town of [Phandalin](/wikis/phandalin), where they hope to meet Gundren Rockseeker, a  guild leader and prospector.

<!--truncate-->
 
Half a day from the town, they are ambushed by goblins, and find evidence that [Hudson Abadeir](/characters/hudson) of the Crossroad Knights has been captured and taken to a nearby hideout. Following tracks left by the goblins, [Urllexin](/characters/urllexin) leads the party to a cave entrance.
 
[Lorna](/characters/lorna) scopes out the cave, leading to the capture and integration of a hapless goblin watchman, who tells them that Gundren has been kidnapped and taken to King Grol, who the goblins in the cave report to. The party also become aware that Hudson Abadeir is inside, held in the ‘eating cave’.
 
The party charges in, avoiding wolves and narrowly avoiding a water trap designed to repel intruders, and after a flawlessly executed ambush manages to rescue Hudson, who is furious at his capture and the loss of his sword,[Laventius’ Bane](/wikis/laventius-bane). He offers the party a reward for getting him safely to [Phandalin](/wikis/phandalin), and the party, exhausted and injured, agrees.
