Kharl, Varyk and Dakarai ready themselves to go further into the caves, the way behind closed to them. In the night, Kharl wakes to see Dakarai staring deep into an orb they are holding – in the morning, he is gone. After waiting for a time, Varyk and Kharl make their way into the darkness below, Varyk leading with Kharl in tow, tied by a rope.

Making their way through natural caverns, they find that they are sealed *in*, a warning to drow from the order side saying not to go any further. The pair surmise that the drow they have fought so far came from below, not above.
 
Talking their way past a pair of drow sentries, spooked by the early resurrection of Xullraen happening in an adjacent sanctum, the pair make their way out of the temple complex and into the ruins of an underground city. Cautiously making their way through the ruins, the party stumbles upon the nest of a chimera. After a brief exchange, Kharl banishes the Chimera and claims its hoard – 75kgs of copper and silver coins.
 
Stumbling upon a much larger part of the ruined city, and weighed down with treasure, Kharl hides while Varyk scouts. Varyk finds the reason for the lightly protected inner sanctum – the drow are being attacked by orcs and goblins to the south. Using the attack as a cover, Kharl, masquerading as a prisoner and Varyk talk their way through the front lines and out of the drow city.
 
Finding their way to an underground river, Varyk is approached by a goblin that claims to know the party, as Kharl gave these orcs Lightbringer back in the Spellforge. Kharl takes the goblins hand and asks to be led to their seer, Kugs, the blind goblin.
