Days earlier, Urllex finds her way into her aunt Urzoth’s tomb, to find her half alive and almost completely encased in a living prison of sea-life. Time accelerates as Urzoth speaks, as she is almost a statue at this point.

Urzoth berates Urllex for coming to late, and not growing into the paladin that she had hoped for. The two argue , and Urzoth accepts that Urllex will always be a hot-headed wanderer.
 
Urzoth tells the story of how she came to be like this – fifty years ago, Urzoth and Kharl the Elder became aware of a darkness threatening every ocean. The ancient elven god of the sea, [Deep Sashelas](/wikis/deep-sashelas), had become corrupted, devolving into a mindless, all consuming demonic entity. On the behest of their gods, the pair sought out a party consisting of Gundren Rockseeker, Lillen Shadowcloak, Kaz and Tock, and stole Sashelas seven gifts from the demon [Kyuss](/wikis/Kyuss/new).
 
Using these, they sealed Deep Sashelas away, creating the Maelstrom, the same event that destroyed Castien and smashed the elven city into the Beast Coast. Urzoth refers to this event as her penance.
 
The party separated, each taking one of the gifts with them (leaving the seventh, the black, which was later stolen by Xullraen). Urzoth accepted the curse of Life, and as such she is slowly being consumed by the sea, but has accepted this. She tells Urllex that through this acceptance, Urzoth will become the seed of a new god, that will be able to fight Sashelas in ascension and defeat them for good.
 
Urzoth warns Urllex that in seven months, a great tide will come, and the Maelstrom will not be able to contain Sashelas. Before then, they must gather what gifts they can and go to face Seshales in the material plane.
 
Urllex is gifted a Cloak of the Kraken and sent on her way. Sensing Kharl and Varyk’s location, she swims from Urzoth’s tomb to the underdark, bursting out of the water just as Kharl is being introduced to the goblin Hogstrom.
 
The party is led into the orc and goblin controlled caves, revealling that their attack against the Drow had gone badly, but they still had strength behind them, including a tame Otyugh, ‘Spike.’ Entering another section of ruined city, the party is presented to the goblin seer Kugs. Kugs welcomes Urllexin as ‘Lightbringer,’ but reveals that many orcs wear that mantle, and that they rule as a collective, weirding Urllex out. The party learns that the orcs, using Lightbringer, had freed themselves from Drow control and were in the process of escaping to the surface, but were cut off by Xullraen’s forces above.
 
Kharl promises to perform a scrying ceremony in the morning and goes away to prepare. Urllex meditates on her position, as Kharl goes looking for somewhere to offload his bounty of coins, stumbling upon Debope the Wheel’d, this time at an establishment labelled as ‘Goblin Have.’ There, he trades some coins and belongings for a retractable pole and a golden mask.
 
Returning to the orc guest house, the party settles in for the night.
