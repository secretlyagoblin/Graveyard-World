After a successful day of conning rich travellers out of their money, [Magicami](/characters/magicami) set out to get good and drunk at a local dive bar. There, he befriended [Arvahnt](/characters/arvahnt), a young Vyln who had just left [The Nameless Forest](/wikis/the-nameless-forest) for the first time.

Leaving the bar, the pair were cornered by a gang of thugs. After an ungainly getaway attempt that left them both tangled on the ground, Magicami charmed the gang leader, convincing him to lead them to his boss, the [Shadow](/characters/shadow).
 
Upon entering the back-room of the [Shadowâ€™s](/characters/shadow) base of operations, the ruse fell apart, the charmed thugs shaken to awareness. Upon realising the danger they were in Arvahnt decided to shoot first and ask questions later, killing [Shadow](/characters/shadow) and two of his men.
 
After a tense hostage negotiation, Magicami managed to the convince the last of the thugs to leave town, the pair staggered back to the inn, pausing only to loot the lockbox.
