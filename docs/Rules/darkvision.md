Only Dark Elves and other truly subterranian creatures have darkvision. All other characters that have darkvision instead have ‘low light vision.’
 
A creature with low-light vision can see twice as far as standard in starlight, moonlight, distant torchlight, and similar conditions of shadowy illumination. It retains the ability to distinguish color and detail under these conditions. A spellcaster with low-light vision can read a scroll as long as even the tiniest candle flame is next to her as a source of light.
 
If a strong source of light is within 30 feet of the character, and the characters low-light vision is not magical in origin, that characters low-light vision ceases to apply due to their eyes adjusting.
