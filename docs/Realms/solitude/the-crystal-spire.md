A vast crystal shell that encased a temple of the old god [Xaviara – The Iron that Binds](/wikis/xaviara), who’s realm was thrown into chaos by the events detailed in “Arkenreln Chapter 1: Wall Of Flesh.”
 
In the years since the stranding of Highhaven, the crystal shell has been converted into a vast lens, used by powerful wizards to create paths into Ascension, although it is dangerous and temperamental at best.
