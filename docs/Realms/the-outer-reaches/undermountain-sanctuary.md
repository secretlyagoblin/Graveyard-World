A powerful site of reflection and focus for the Thing-Talker [druids](/wikis/druids-of-the-outer-reaches) of the mountains of The Outer Reaches. The main chamber is a cave containing a breathtaking crystalline formation. Many druids come here to meditate and carve their base animal spirit into the crystals as an offering to all spirits (animal, mineral and plant) of the region as part of their [rite of passage](/wikis/druids-of-the-outer-reaches-rite-of-passage).
