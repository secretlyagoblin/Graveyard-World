A large town a week out of [Overcairn](/wikis/the-portal-city-of-overcairn), Norge employs a large number of miners and alchemists who work at the nearby [Negative Energy Mines](/wikis/the-negative-energy-mines).
 
Discerning and wealthy customers travel for days to visit the Forge of Norge, where the finest arms, armour and jewellery are created by the proprietor, [George-of-the-Forgefire](/characters/george-of-the-forgefire). Ancient artefacts and objects of archaeological importance that are unearthed from the mines are taken to [Silent Randy’s](/characters/randy) for identification, although Randy’s answers generally provide more questions than answers.
 
Though the town is bustling and energetic, a well organised local militia maintains the peace, and the geography and location of the town mean it is generally beyond the reach of [The Caster of Shadows](/characters/the-caster-of-shadows). However, troubles in the capital and surrounding countryside have caused refugees to flood into the city, stretching the towns resources.
