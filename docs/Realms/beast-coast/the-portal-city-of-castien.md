Castien was founded on Orcish lands along the Beast Coast by  [Alu Tel](/wikis/alu-tel) refugees fifty years ago, following the cataclysmic destruction of the homeland of the by the Maelstrom. While initially the Orcish communities were accommodating, offering the Aluâ€™Tel supplies and assistance, conflicts soon flared up as settlement intensified and Castien was connected into the Lodestone Network.
 
There have been multiple clashes between the colonists and the natives, leading to the death or banishment of many leading figures in the Orcish communities, including [Urllexin](/characters/urllexin).
 
Castien itself sits on the cliffs above [Old Castien](/wikis/old-castien), where only the most fundamentalist elves still live to truly worship the sea. Many elves in Castien proper believe that the sea has abandoned the Alu-Tel, and they instead have shifted their worship towards the sky, building [the Ivory Palace](/wikis/the-ivory-palace) partially in response to this.
