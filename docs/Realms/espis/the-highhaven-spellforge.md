The Highhaven Spellforge was built hundreds of years ago over a vast well of magical energy. The old council of Highhaven used to trade the powerful artifacts created here to the cities of [The Inner Ring](/wikis/the%20Inner%20Ring/new).
 
Weeks before the relocation of [the Portal City of Highhaven](/wikis/the-portal-city-of-highhaven), [Jaitus Kalo](/characters/kalo) attacked the forge, killing the mages and protectors who lived within, and used the forge to create the unique lodestone required to complete his plans.
 
Kaloâ€™s plan was successful, and the Spellforge has been lost in the chaos ever since, although the dwarf Gundren Rockseeker claims to have discovered a way back to the forge..
