New Haven was founded 10 years ago by a party of adventurers known as the [Crossroad Knights](/wikis/The%20Crossroad%20Knights/new), in order to rebind together the settlements ripped asunder by the disappearance of [The Portal City of Highhaven](/wikis/the-portal-city-of-highhaven).
 
New Haven is a low, open city that has a far more grounded attitude to the governing of its lands than the old Council of Highhaven, and mostly exists as a hub for trade, bustling in the weeks after the harvest season, but otherwise quiet.
 
Still, after all these years, refugees from the original collapse are still finding their way home through the lodestone portal, and rangers of the Crossroad Knights can be regularly observed leading caravans into the wild hills, in search of old homes.
