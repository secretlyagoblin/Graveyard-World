People who follow a school of unnatural, science-based druidic magic. Just as druids attune themselves to natural spirits (animal, mineral and plant), chaos druids attune themselves to unnatural and chaotic spirits (unexplained, mechanical and otherworldly).
 
The transformational magic they use is based in science, created by the scientists and wizards of the overpopulated and poverty-stricken cities that wished to be able to attune with spirits and change their forms just like the druids. Without a connection to natural world, they instead used a combination of machines and magic to fuse with the unnatural spirits of the cities.
 
The magic itself is incredibly unstable and difficult to control. Many of its practitioners lose their minds or make a mistake and kill themselves trying to fuse with something.
 
Little is known of the origins of the machine druids but the records of them only date back about a hundred years.

## The tale of Simon the Unnatural

Simon had always dreamed of being a druid. He grew up in the entombed slums of Overcairn. Looking after stray animals, studying magic and science, these things took up most of his time. As a child had heard tales of the druids. People with the talent to shift into powerful beasts. People so in tune with nature they could ask things of elements themselves. People with the power to become gods.
   
 However no natural talent for the natural lay in his weak and crippled limbs. Though he did have a brilliant mind for science. Using this knowledge, and the knowledge of magic he had picked up over the years. Simon eventually built a machine. An unnatural machine. A machine meant to fuse the minds of two creatures.  
 Whether they be human or beast. The intention was to become closer with the animals he had adopted and befriended over the years. The result was devastating for him. The disgust he felt through his friends shattered his dreams. They despised him and his experiments. He began to curse his wretched upbringing. He cursed the unnatural city he was brought up in. He cursed the people laughed at him and his ideas. For they were right. He would never become one of the druids he had heard such tales of as a child. The only thing he held to was his knowledge. Regardless of the repulsive nature of his machine, it had worked none the less. He kept at his experiments. Fusing for longer and longer times with the animals that despised him so. They became twisted, wretched souls. Remnants of his hate, lingering in their minds. After spending so much time joined to this hateful being, the beasts began to lose their connection with the natural world. Slowly, These creatures were unmade. Re-formed. Forged into something else. Something entirely more reminiscent of the chaos surrounding them.  
 Simon learnt of other creatures, beasts, not undone by science, but warped the entropy of the world. Finally, Simon felt as if he was not alone. His science and thirst for knowledge thrived.  
 Simon refined his science. Made it portable. He became attuned the machines he constantly poured himself into.   
 Simon had finally become the druid he always wanted, only wrong.   
 He could not feel the mountains, he only felt his machines.   
 He could not feel the creatures of the forest, only the tainted souls of creatures lost to chaos.  
 He could not feel harmony, only discord.  
 And he relished it.
