### Valentina Fyfe
 Witch of some power. Flanked by constructs. Likes city living, likes the good life, and can be found travelling all over the place. Houses in many cities, travels back to central when required, although most systems are automated now. Possibly sent out to set up permanent camp if expeditions are disappearing.
 
### Vanderbourne  
 Ex-military artificer. Arm has been replaced by machine. Was recruited for inner ring war, used the time to hone craft. When paired with a powerful spellcaster, can create massive war golems. Not so interested in one-of-a-kind weapons, more mass armaments. That’s where the cash is.
 
### Edea Wormwood  
 Buisnesswoman – happily does deals with demons/mortals. Only travels by summoning circle these days. Even though the cost is enormous, she loves being independent. Deal with Cherintanos, in exchange for something… maybe still just the destruction of the inner circle.
 
### Druid Guides + Ranger Trackers
 These people undertake the actual journeys to get materials. Mercenaries.
