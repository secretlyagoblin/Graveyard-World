Many legends and songs of the cities speak of [Bakurus](/characters/bakurus), one of few druids of The Outer Reaches to [ascend](/wikis/druids-of-the-outer-reaches-rite-of-passage).

## Rite of Passage

The aim of any self-respecting druid of the Outer Reaches is to ascend and become a deity. The first step towards this goal is undergoing a rite of passage.
 
This rite of passage begins the first time a child changes their shape. That child must be sent into the land of which the shape they shifted into resides and find spirits to attune with there. This usually happens around the age of ten.
 
The second stage dictates that a druid must leave the land to which they are attuned and head out into the civilized world to improve the quality of life of itâ€™s inhabitants in any way they deem necessary.
 
Nothing is currently known about the Third and Final stages of the ascension.
