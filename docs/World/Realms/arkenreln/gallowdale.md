A tourist town in the loosest sense of the word, Gallowdale serves as the last stop for travellers on the way to [The Valley of Tombs](/wikis/the-valley-of-tombs), which provides the town with a steady stream of income from graverobbers, gravediggers and grievers. Gallowdale was the first human settlement visited by [Arvahnt](/characters/arvahnt), and was where she had the ill luck of meeting [Humble Hank](/characters/humble-hank) and [Magicami](/characters/magicami).
 
Though the town has a corrupt underbelly, it maintains a strong civic image, ruled for centuries by the [Eclectus](/characters/eclectus) family from a central keep. Nobody has heard from the town since the battle for the[Abyssal Crown](/wikis/abyssal-crown) took place, and its adjacency to the [The Fleshwaste](/wikis/the-fleshwaste) is enough to deter many from trying to make contact.
