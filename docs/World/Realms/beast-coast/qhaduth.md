Known to the occupying elves as simply “Ward 42,” this coastal town on [The Beast Coast](/wikis/the-beast-coast) once ran as a communal fishing village, called by the locals Qhaduthatheba (from “salt-cliffs by the sea” (some of the old folk still pronounce the tooth-gnash in the middle.))
 
In recent times the place has been overrun by elves, imposing rigid rules, a ruthless export economy, and suppressing the religion of the orcs.
 
Rich humans and their entourages often visit, doing business with the alu tel sea Elves, and holidaying on the bleach-white beaches. They don’t know the stories the orcs still tell, of how they built the beaches themselves from the bones of the beasts that gave this coast its’ name.
