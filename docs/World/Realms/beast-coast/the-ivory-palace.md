Towering in elegant, stepped glory above [the Portal City of Castien](/), carved into the stone and ivory that forms [Qhaduthâ€™s](/) tusk, the Ivory Palace formed the grand new centerpiece of the now land-dwelling [Alu-Tel](/) civilisation. 

Completing the palace, and using it as a defensive barrier around the [Castien Lodestone](/) was the key project that the nobility of Casten hoped would allow Castien back into the Inner Ring. 

The palace was ransacked by local insurgents as part of the fall of Castien and now is now slowly being reclaimed by nature.

Many civilisations have tried to make a home in the tusk before, and the cliffs below the palace are riddled with passages, some used by servants and works, and some boarded up and forgotten..
