Old Castien was once the jewel of the Alu-Tel empire, a core part of the Inner Ring. Then, 50 years ago, the city was destroyed by the Maelstrom, and itâ€™s bones were smashed into the Beast Coast, where they rot today. These days, Old Castien is primarily occupied by only the most fundamentalist of Sashelas worshipers.
