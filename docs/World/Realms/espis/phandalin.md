Phandalin is a human village located southeast of [New Haven](/wikis/the-portal-city-of-new-haven), which has recently been reclaimed following the resettling of Espis by the Crossroad Knights.
 
Phandalin has become a frontier settlement of farmers and prospectors looking for relics of the old Espis. After the death of Harbin Wester, the town is run by an elected Townmaster named Halia Thornton, founder of the  Miner’s exchange.
 
In the days before the collapse of Espis, Phandalin was the ancestral home of [Duke Laventius](/characters/laventius), and the mansion has fallen into disrepair, and nobody knows what happened to the Duke.
