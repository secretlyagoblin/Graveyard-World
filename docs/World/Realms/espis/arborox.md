Arborox was a halfing and human village located far south of Highhaven, though the town is a ruin now. In the time after the collapse, it appears that the villagers turned to using [The-Iron-That-Binds](/wikis/xaviara) to hold the town together, eventually sacrificing people to her. Though the town still exists,  the corrupting influence of the ritual has consumed the town, driving out the original inhabitance and drawing dark forces to the settlement, including a young green dragon.
 
The town watched over by the druid Reidoth, who is slowly trying to cure the town of itâ€™s corruption.
