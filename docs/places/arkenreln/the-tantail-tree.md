The Tantail Tree of Mesphyr was planted by [Arvahnt](/characters/arvahnt) and [Atrius Lammergeier](/characters/atrius) at the center of a defiled shrine deep within the catacombs below [Overcairn](/wikis/the-portal-city-of-overcairn). The seed, delivered at the behest of [Nink](/wikis/nink-ferret-god-of-healing-and-restoration), gestated around the ancient calcified body of [Mesphyr](/wikis/mesphyr-chameleon-god-of-disguise-and-deceit) and grew into a great tree which now grows high above the city, providing the citizens with beauty, safety, and an abundance of fallen fruit.
 
The deep roots of the tree have stabilised the city, undoing the damage caused by the Wall of Flesh (see Chapter 1), purifying and restricting access to much of the undercity in the process.
 
Those attuned to the forest can feel Mesphyrâ€™s presence in and around the tree, and those seeking to interfere with its growth or harvest its fruits have a tendency to go missing.
