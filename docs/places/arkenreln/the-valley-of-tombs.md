The Valley of Tombs was one of the first ancient sites rediscovered when the settlement of Arkenreln was founded. Those who discovered it considered the valley to be the resting place of the old kings and gods, leading to a tradition of the early lords of [Overcairn](/wikis/the-portal-city-of-overcairn) being buried in the valley. Nowadays, even families that had long left Arkenreln ask to be taken back to the Valley and buried there. As such, there is a constant parade of funeral marches going through the valley.
 
It was long rumoured that the last bearer of the [Abyssal Crown](/wikis/abyssal-crown) was buried in the valley, a rumour that proved true when [Magicami](/characters/magicami), [Humble Hank](/characters/humble-hank) and [Arvahnt](/characters/arvahnt) rediscovered it in horrifying circumstances. [The Fleshwaste](/wikis/the-fleshwaste) sits between civilisation and the valley now, and nobody who has seeked out the valley has returned.
