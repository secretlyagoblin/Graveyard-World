Though the Wall of Flesh that assaulted [Overcairn](/wikis/the-portal-city-of-overcairn) was purified and absorbed by [the Tantail Tree](/wikis/the-tantail-tree), the trail left in its wake remains a wasteland. Dark creatures stalk it in the night, trees cry out for death and rivers of bile flow across its blighted landscape. [The Ferret God Nink](/wikis/nink-ferret-god-of-healing-and-restoration) has sensed that the formation of the Fleshwaste has caused the stirring of an evil below Arkenreln, a Lich of great power, and the fear of those in [Overcairn](/wikis/the-portal-city-of-overcairn) grows with each day, as the cries beyond the walls begin to worsen.
