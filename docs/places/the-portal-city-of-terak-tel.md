Loosely translated as Empireâ€™s Cradle, this city sits in a shelted basin at the center of the vast desert, surrounded on all sides by the bodies of dying collosi and looked over by the sobbing visage of vast Aria. At the center of the basin, a purple oasis brings life to a bustling city. Though this may seem precarious, these collosi have behaved consistenly for thousands of years, and the locals have long made piece with the apparent knife edge that they live on.
 
Adventurers make use of Terak Tel as a staging ground to go deep into the desert to investigate old empire ruins, long abandoned after some unknown calamity.
 
Curiously, Terak Tel seems to be a corruption of Toro Tel, which means Empty Cradle, indicating to some scholars that the spring and basin itself may have some metaphysical link to Aria herself.
