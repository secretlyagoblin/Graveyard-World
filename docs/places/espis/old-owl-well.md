An old granary and military outpost from the days before Highhaven disappeared. Towns would store their goods here in the winter, and collected taxes and luxury items would be kept here briefly before being transported  back to Highhaven.
 
Old Owl Well is abandoned now, and the outpost has been barricaded from the outside, with signs of destruction and conflict everywhere inside. Inspecting the interior reveals that the mechanism allowing access to the granary and vault has been closed and broken to prevent entry, and the blood coating the iron door acts as a clear indication that this place has fallen to darkness.
