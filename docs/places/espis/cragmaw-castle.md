An ancient, crumbling castle comprised of seven interlocking towers, Cragmaw Castle (as it is known now) is a relic of the age before the lodestone network, when the chaos meant that civilised settlements were small, and governance was localised.
 
Though little more than a ruin now, it is often used as a home base by roaming bands of brigands, or animals waiting out a particularly harsh bout of bad weather.
