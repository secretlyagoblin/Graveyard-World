A oppressively quiet and dark section of woodland  that hugs the southern edge of [the Scar](/wikis/the-scar). This wood is guarded and roamed by the banshee Agatha, once an elven woman exiled from the high society of the Inner Circle. Though she once divined for the living, her mood has changed of late, and few dare to set foot in her wood any more.
