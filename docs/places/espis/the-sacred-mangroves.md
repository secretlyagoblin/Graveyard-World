A sacred copse of hybrid boreal-mangroves, grown from roots brought to the swamp by [Lorna](/characters/lorna) and tended to by Bullywug druids, this is a place of powerful natural energy. The copse has always been a place of power, but the ravaging of the land by [the White Iron Company](/wikis/the-white-iron-company) lead to the original trees being uprooted and carried away for some dark purpose.
 
It was here that Lorna was presented with the [Flowering Bow](/wikis/flowering-bow), grown naturally from one of the mangrove saplings.
