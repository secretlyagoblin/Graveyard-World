The Scar is a vast, deep canyon that splits the land of Espis from east to west, ending at the ocean. Though the druids of the land have continue to work at taming the Scar, and healing the land, the trench will probably remain a major feature of the landscape for millennia before healing, if it can truly be healed. The Scar is at itâ€™s widest at the spot where [Highhaven](/wikis/the-portal-city-of-highhaven) once stood, and ranges in biome from bare canyon, dark wood, and deep swamp.
 
The northern side of the Scar, where [the Portal City of New Haven](/wikis/the-portal-city-of-new-haven) stands, has already been heavily cultivated, and is dotted all over with towns and farms. The southern side is wilder, and can only easily be accessed by cart by crossing [Harker Canyon](/wikis/harker-canyon). As such, it is far less populated.
