The Ice Trench is a deep gully that completely surrounds [Highhaven-In-Solitude](/wikis/the-portal-city-of-highhaven). This unnatural formation was created by sudden heat and pressure of Highhavenâ€™s appearance, quickly frozen into a slick, virtually unassailable barrier to the outside world.
 
[Jaitus Kalo](/characters/kalo) bored a vast tunnel through the Ice Trench during his expedition to find [The Crystal Spire](/wikis/the-crystal-spire), allowing passage out to the ice wastes for those who know the way.
