An ascended deity, Mesphyr takes the physical form of a chameleon. Before ascending, Mesphys was an elvish druid attuned to [The Nameless Forest](/wikis/the-nameless-forest).
 
[The Tantail Tree](/wikis/the-tantail-tree) was formed around its ancient calcified body in the catacombs below [Overcairn](/wikis/the-portal-city-of-overcairn).
 
[Atrius Lammergeier](/characters/atrius) has studied its essence and is now able to assume its chameleon form.
