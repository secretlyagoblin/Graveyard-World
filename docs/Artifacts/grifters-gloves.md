Requires attunement. As a free action, for a duration of 1 minute, the user can add their dexterity and charisma scores together and change either modifer (dexterity and charisma ) to the total of this, to a maximum of +5. The modifier that is not chosen is changed to -1 for the duration.
 
The gloves have a maximum of 10 charges, and recover 1d4 charges each day at midnight. The gloves will regain an extra charge for each successful grift performed that day.
 
If the gloves fall beneath 5 charges, they will not charge unless the wearer successfully performs a grift that day.
 
If no grifts are performed within three days of the gloves falling below 5 charges, the gloves crawl off your hands, and seek out a new owner.
