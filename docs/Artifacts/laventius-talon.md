Found by [Urllexin Last Name Here](/characters/urllexin), deep beneath the Laventius family estate. The sword had been hoarded away by a feral Nothic, who had somehow got a hold of it. The sword had a secret compartment that contanined Duke Laventiusâ€™ final will and testament.
 
After attunement, this +1 longsword allows the wielder to cast Jump on themselves as a free action. After the spell has been cast, it cannot be cast again until the user has meditated with the sword for half an hour.
