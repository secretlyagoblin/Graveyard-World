Forged and enchanted by the great wizard [Cherintanos](/characters/cherintanos), the one who holds this staff gains the ability to manipulate, fuse and control any creature of flesh, living or dead. After the disappearance of its master, the Staff somehow found its way into the hands of his thirteenth son, [Doug](/characters/doug).
 
In the aftermath of the battle for the [Abyssal Crown](/wikis/abyssal-crown), the Staff became the catalyst of the wall of flesh that almost destroyed [The Portal City of Overcairn](/wikis/the-portal-city-of-overcairn).
 
The staff was last seen tumbling into the chaos between worlds, along with the [Abyssal Crown](/wikis/abyssal-crown) and souls of all those that it fused with.
