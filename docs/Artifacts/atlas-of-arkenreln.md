A mysterious atlas, the cover emblazoned with an enormous gem, that seems to cover within its pages the location of every tomb and ruin within the bounds of Arkenreln. The book was rediscovered (and vandalised) by [Sacer the Irascible](/characters/sacer) within the [Library of the God of Bloody Light](/wikis/library-of-the-god-of-bloody-light). The book is currently in the possession of [Eilyac](/characters/eilyac), who has been trained to read it by [Silent Randy](/characters/randy).
