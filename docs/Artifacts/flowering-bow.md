The Flowering Bow (*Uâ€™nene Velo*) wsa given to Lorna by the Bullywugs of [the Saltwater Marsh](/wikis/the-saltwater-marsh) for returning a sacred tree to them.
 
As an action or cunning action, the wielder can cause this bow to transform into a longbow. The user can sustain this transformation by continuing to stand still, as a tree would.
 
When transformed, if fired at a target within a forest, the wielder is considered to have cast Ensnaring Strike on themselves.
