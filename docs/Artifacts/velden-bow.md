The Velden Bow (*Velden  Velo*) was bestowed upon [Arvahnt](/characters/arvahnt) when she pledged herself to [Nink, the Ferret (God) of Healing and Restoration](/wikis/nink-ferret-god-of-healing-and-restoration).
 
The bow shares Nink’s abhorrence of the unnatural, and seeks to destroy any such creature it comes across.
 
It is made of a single piece of living wood which lives wrapped around the arm and shoulder of the bearer until it is needed, when it will immediately envelop the hand and stretch out forming a strong and accurate bow.
 
Because it lives, attached to and almost a part of its’ bearer, it can be used by them and only  them. In the event of the bearer’s death it would form a beautiful tree around the remains, ensuring respectful burial of their physical form.
