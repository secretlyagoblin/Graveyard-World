Adorned with an ornate clasp bearing the symbol of the [Outer Reaches](/wikis/the-outer-reaches), this fine cloak attunes itself with a druidâ€™s base animal spirit, easing the transformation into that animal. Found by [Atrius](/characters/atrius) on the body of [Azenkazahel](/characters/azenkazahel) in the [Library of the God of Bloody Light](/wikis/library-of-the-god-of-bloody-light), it is said to have been crafted by the first [druids of the Outer Reaches](/wikis/druids-of-the-outer-reaches).
