Vulptic is a largely inept Druid. He has the capacity to take a large number of animal forms, most of which are almost completely useless in battle. Since he has spent most of his life alone and without the need to eat or drink, he has mostly taken forms for the purpose of camoflague, exploration, and sometimes (oftentimes) just to be fluffy.
