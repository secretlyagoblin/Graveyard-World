As the party will be using Last Gift as their base of operations for the foreseeable future, they agree to track down Kurk as a portion of thier material contribution in exchange for room and board.\\n \\nTravelling east, they find the cairns just as the sun sets.

As Kurk emerges from the depths, Ursula creates a distraction by dislodging a massive rock, giving No-Pockets time to pull Kurk to saftely and Orgmo to escape to the upper levels, where he comes face to face with the ifrit, 10 feet tall and wrapped in billowing green fire.\\n \\nUrsula strikes the demon in the head with an arrow, but the two are both overpowered by the creatues powerful flaming attacks.\\n \\nNo-Pockets uses this opportunity to enter the library, clearly warded from the ifrit, (and answering the question of why it needed mortal servants to procure books), which the ifrit has been ritually burning to create new smoke servants. Quickly locating and stealing the most expensive looking tome, locked away in an ornate box, No-Pockets inadvertantly lowers the wards protecting the space.\\n \\nThe ifrit, suddenly aware of this, makes its way back to the library, where No-Pockets stabs it in the back with a dagger.\\n \\nSimultaniously, Ursula and Orgmo break through a collapsed doorway into daylight, and move a mirror to

Urzoth accepted the curse of Life, and as such she is slowly being consumed by the sea, but has accepted this.

As the water rises, it floods the maze and entraceway of the mine, creating a perfect defensive line. The flooding is complete just in time, as the woods that the attackers were hiding in become wreathed in flame, presumably started by the White Iron troops in an attempt to drive the bulywugs back into the swamp.\\n \\nDakarai, Kharl and Hudson stay back to guard the mines, while the others make thier way along the cliffs through thick smoke. Spying the White Iron camp, they notice that they are mounting up for combat, while the rest of the camp packs up and heads for the hills. Kharl and Dakarai tend to the wounded, and Kharl returns Leventius\u2019 Bane to Hudson, reinvigorating his morale.\\n \\nUrllex leads the groups through the burning woods and extends the brushfire further onto the plain, forcing the approaching knights to dismount and make their way into the thick smoke along the cliff if they want to attack at all.\\n \\nReturning to the Spellforge through the maze, the trio notice something amiss \u2013 the bodies of dead bullywugs floating in the waist-deep water. Immediately, the trio are set upon by a pair of Displacer Beasts \u2013 the monsters that destroyed Lorna\u2019s home. A short, brutal fight plays out in the water, the party short on health and spells, the displacer beasts ripping and tearing with powerful tentacles. Dakarai goes down after recieving two powerful blows to the chest, and Kharl is flayed within an inch of his life. After the beasts are finally killed, the party returns to land to tend to the wounded, completely exhausted. Though Dakarai has been stabalised, he will not wake.\\n \\nBack with the other defenders, they find that the bullywugs seem to have ambushed the last of the human attackers, sappers who had intended to bring the mine down on their heads. The party waits out the night, and no further attack comes. Emerging the next day, they find the White Iron company gone, obviously appalled at their own losses.\\n \\nTime passes, and the party returns to Phandalin, where they spend weeks recuperating. Dakarai connot be roused, either by medicine or magic, and Kharl concludes that he is trapped in his coma by some powerful entity that he can see brief flashes of when he touches Dakarai\u2019s mind.\\n \\nLorna and Urllex make contact with Halia Thornton, who is now the new mayor, and she suggests that if they want to stop the White Iron Company, they need to target the people paying them \u2013 a group of Artificers known as [Wormwood, Fife and Vanderbourne.](/wikis/wormwood-fife-and-vanderbourne-independent-artificers)\\n \\nKharl gets in a serious disagreement with Halia over her pardoning of two of the redbrand thugs he had arrested \u2013 dragging them by their necks most of the way to the gibbet before he is talked down. He spends the rest of the stay in Phandalin hiding away in the Leventius estate feeling sorry for himself.\\n \\nThe unexpected return of a large halfling contingent from New Haven leads to an impromptu celebration, and also the return of Gundren Rockseeker, who had been in New Haven trying to settle his affairs.\\n \\nTaking the party aside for a meeting, Gundren crypically reveals to the party that decades ago, him, Urllexin\u2019s aunt, and Kharls grandfather saved the world, and that now they are cursed, and refuses to explain how or what from, saying that it would put them all in danger.\\n \\nGundren has in his hands a set of amulets to prevent against scrying, and says they don\u2019t know how much the drows saw when they used the scrying room within the Spellforge, and that they might not have much time.\\n \\nHe tells the party has his funds have been cut off due to civil war in the underdark, and that because of this he plans to organise an expedition to find out what is happening in the drow kingdoms. While he does this, he gives the party two tasks \u2013 to go to Highhaven University and contact the headmaster, and to travel to Skypiercer temple to help Kharl the Elder ascend as Rhobsarendor.\\n \\nKharl asks Gundren \u201cwhat he knows of salt,\u201d the curse that had befallen his grandfather. Suprisingly, this causes Kyuss, present within Varyk, to snarl in fury.\\n \\nSeemingly putting two and two about something together, Kyuss fully possesses Varyk and assaults Gundren,  crying out in Abyssal, accusing him of theft.

Kharl tasks the party with finding Rhob, and taking him to Skypeircer temple, for which they will need a map, and then conducting a ritual to allow him to ascend properly. Kharl the Elder then leaves for the astral reflection of skypeircer temple, telling Kharl that everything would be explained when he knows it is safe to do so.\\n \\nAs the sun rises, the party returns to the ocean, and re-enters the bullywug grove through the reflection in the water."},{"id":"espis-chapter-10-the-white-iron-company","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/espis-chapter-10-the-white-iron-company","editUrl":"https://github.com/secretlyagoblin/graveyard-world/tree/main/blog/2017-06-18-espis-chapter-10-the-white-iron-company.md","source":"@site/blog/2017-06-18-espis-chapter-10-the-white-iron-company.md","title":"Espis Chapter 10: The White Iron Company","description":"Kyuss steals Zyn\u2019s skull and slinks off with Varyk to confront and blackmail the buried drow \u2013 Xullraen T\u2019orgh.
